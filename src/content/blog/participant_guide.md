CC0 1.0 Universal

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

## What is a Mod Garden?
Mod Garden is a Minecraft Mod creation event where modders will create mods under a specific theme over a timeframe of two months.

Mod Garden also has a showcase world for everyone to explore the new mods created after development has concluded.

For more information on each stage of Mod Garden please read the [Garden Timeline](/blog/mod-garden-timeline).

## Who can Participate?
Anybody who can provide something towards a mod can participate.

Programmers, artists, musicians, new modders, veteran modders, skill is not a requirement for Mod Garden, only commitment. We're all learning in some way.

Take things at your own pace and work within a scope you can handle, so you can work towards a finished mod. We're an anti-crunch environment here, so don't bite off more than you can chew.

You may work either entirely solo or on a team, we will help facilitate people looking for a team to work with during planning phase and beyond.

## How to Participate?
To participate, [join the Discord server](https://discord.modgarden.net) and run the `/register` and `/link modrinth` commands.

When an event starts there will be an announcement in `#garden-announcements` from GardenBot. This message will have a button at the bottom, which will allow you to register.

Alternatively you may run the `/event register` command.

If you ever wish to drop out of the event whilst it is running, you may run the `/event unregister` command on the Discord bot.

As soon as you are finished with your mod, you may use the `/event submit` command.

If others worked on the mod, as the person who initially submitted the project, you may run `/project invite author` to add them to the project.

If you have any additional builders, you may run `/project invite builder` to add a user to build your project.

To leave a project, you may run `/project leave`.

### Requirements and Rules for Participating
- Your Mod Garden account must be linked with your Modrinth account if you are a developer and your Minecraft account(s) if you are building.
- Projects must be uploaded to Modrinth.
    - Unlisted projects are allowed, just make sure the project is on Modrinth.
- Projects must be original.
  - Assets used from other projects must be credited in the mod's description. This includes assets used by the same author.
- Projects must be source visible.
    - This is so others besides yourself may take a look at any issues regarding your mod, and to make sure that there are no backdoors/other under the hood content within your mod.
- Projects must be compatible with the event's Minecraft and Modloader (and API) version.
  - For example, an event running on 1.21.1 Fabric means that to submit you'll need a version listed compatible with 1.21.1 and Fabric on Modrinth.
- Projects must not violate others' copyright.
- Projects are not allowed to use AI. This applies to both AI generated code and AI generated assets.

## Booth Guidelines
Booths are showcases for submissions. These are where players will interact with your mod.

Please read the [Booth Claiming Guide](/blog/booth-claiming-guide) as that has pre-liminary information for before you build your booth. 

If you do not wish to build a booth, you may ask the team to build your booth or ask be left out of the showcase world.

### Booths Must:
- Be connected to the main path in some regard.
- Not be connected to the main path more than once, unless it is a loop in which it may not be connected more than twice.
- Are not allowed to be built in a way where you could skip another booth whilst travelling on the intended path.
- A single author may not take up more than 60% of space of a biomemass.
  - For example, you are not allowed to claim an entire Pale Garden whilst other booths may want/need that spot.
- Not intrude on others' booths without explicit permission.

### Navigation Tips
- All booths will have a warp to make sure that players don't get lost, make sure what is the entrance of the booth is clear and communicated to players.
- The server has a world map mod, use this to improve spatial awareness within your booths.

## Petal Guidelines
Petals are our reflavouring of ModFest's [Scattered Shards](https://modrinth.com/mod/scattered-shards) mod. Petals are collectibles obtained from visiting the booth, otherwise obtained whilst doing **relevant** challenges within booths.

Booths will always have a visitor petal, which is always placed at the front of the booth, rewarding a player for visiting your booth. The visitor petal will be of a specific type, and will only be allowed to be used as a visitor petal.

Other than this petal, you may have up to two bonus petals. These are rewarded for interacting with your booth in various ways, such as by using an item from your mod.

### Bonus Petals Must:
- Be relevant to the mod at hand.
- Routing for a petal must be obvious to a player interacting with the booth in an intended way.
    - If you wish to make a hidden easter egg, the reward/payoff should be something else.
- Petals should not be intentionally time wasting. 
    - For example; Avoid mazes or long term goals such as using an item 1000 times.
