## What is a Claim?

Claims are guidelines to show the space that you will be showcasing your mod. 

Claims are used to give others guidelines for where elements may be, please do connect with your neighbors to make sure that they are happy with your own claims being around.

Modifying other people's claims or claiming within another person's claim without permission, including the claims of Mod Garden staff like the main path claim, is prohibited.

## How do I claim a booth?
As soon as the Testing Phase starts, the Mod Garden Team will provide a Server IP to connect to for participants to claim booths on. This will be the future build server.

Whilst on this server, you should only ever use it to claim your booth, doing anything else on this server is not appreciated during this time.

## The Types of Claims

Mod Garden utilizes three different types of claims for showing what goes where.
Mod Garden's claim types are the Booth Claim, the Path Claim and the Dressing Claim.

All claims must:
- Be at least around 40 blocks above the general terrain of the below area.

> ## ðŸ’¡ Tip
> 
> With WorldEdit, you may use the **/up** command to teleport yourself up a specified amount of blocks, you will have glass placed under you after the teleport, perfect for quickly getting to an elevated height.

Claims are not final and are purely just guidelines so the team can estimate how large participant's areas are. If you have empty space or communicate with neighbors about who gets a specific space, all is fine.

### Booth Claims

Booth claims are claims for showing where your mod's content is shown off. These are typically small, but hold a lot of weight.

Booth Claims are denoted using any Wool block besides White Wool.

#### Booth Claims must:
- Have an entrance distinguished with White Wool. These entrance markers should typically be 3 or 5 blocks long depending on the size of your booth.
- Have a Glowcase Text Block denoting the name of the mod, as well as who the author of the mod is.

### Path Claims

Path claims are claims for showing the intended foot path for visitors to navigate the area around modded claims. You'll find examples of this on the map already, as the main road claims have been set up already by Mod Garden staff.

Path Claims are denoted using any Terracotta block besides White Terracotta - which is the colour used by Mod Garden staff for the main roads.

#### Path Claims must:
- Make sure its obvious as to which booth claim(s) they originate from.
- Not be used to bypass other booths
- Not be built out of White Terracotta

### Dressing Claims

Dressing claims are claims for set dressing, this would be any thematic rebuilding of an area that is not relevant to the showcase area of the mod.

These can be as large as you wish (within reason) and will typically stem from what would originally be a booth area.

Dressing Claims are denoted using Stained Glass.

#### Dressing Claims must:
- Make sure its obvious as to which booth claim(s) they originate from.
