## What is a Booth Claim?

Booth Claims are guidelines to show the space that you will be showcasing your mod.

Booth claims are used to give others guidelines for where your booth may be, please do connect with your neighbors to make sure that they are happy with your own booth being around.

## How do I claim a booth?
As soon as the Testing Phase starts, the Mod Garden Team will provide a Server IP to connect to for participants to claim booths on. This will be the future build server.

Whilst on this server, you should only ever use it to claim your booth, doing anything else on this server is not appreciated during this time.

Booth claims must:
- Be bordered with any Wool block other than White Wool.
- Have an entrance distinguished with White Wool. These entrance markers should typically be 3 or 5 blocks long depending on the size of your booth.
- Be at least around 40 blocks above the general terrain of the below area.
- Have a Glowcase Text Block denoting the name of the mod, as well as who the author of the mod is.
- Not be larger than 40mÂ² in the area it covers.

> ## ðŸ’¡ Tip
> 
> With WorldEdit, you may use the **/up** command to teleport yourself up a specified amount of blocks, you will have glass placed under you after the teleport, perfect for quickly getting to an elevated height.
