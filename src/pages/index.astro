            We are a Minecraft Modding focused event host, focusing on providing
            events that both players and modders alike can enjoy. We have more
            of an focus on long standing projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            We run Mod Garden, a multi-month long event where developers get together to develop a mod within a 2-month timeframe and showcase their mods in a server environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aim to support developers' visions as best as we can, and help
            them set up their entry to be a project for the long run if they
            wish.
